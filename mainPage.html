  <p><!-- welcome message explaining the aim of the website-->
     <br> Welcome to Music Buddy !<br><br> The aim of this website is to help people throughout their day by providing them with music that fits their needs. Many researches have shown that music had a good impact on the mood and well being of individuals, which is why this website has been created.<br><br> This website has 3 sections: the happy music section, the motivational music section, and the relaxing music section. These 3 different kinds of music were chosen because of the positive influence they can have on people in difficult moments.<br><br>In addition to music, this website also contains some links that can be useful to people struggling with mental health issues. The links that this website provides contain helpful information and contacts for people who need to talk to someone about their struggles.<br><br> I hope that this website will be useful for some people.<br><br>Thank You for your visit !
